# NLP-Powered-Sentiment-Classifier-for-News-Text

****Objective:****
Construct a classifier capable of categorizing a sentence's sentiment polarity as either positive or negative.

**Task 1: Sentiment Polarity Classifier Development**
1. Created a classifier for sentence-level sentiment polarity analysis.
2. Initiated the task with "bag-of-words" features.
3. Employed the NaiveBayes classifier and implemented multi-fold cross-validation.
4. Calculated precision, recall, and F-measure scores.
5. Conducted experiments with at least two different feature sets, including stop word filtering, negation handling, and sentiment lexicon usage.
6. Selected the sentence_polarity dataset, providing a brief rationale for the choice.


**Task 2: Sentiment Analysis of "Fake" and "Real" Text**
1. Applied the sentiment polarity classifier to identify positive or negative sentences in fake and real news articles.
2. Analyzed the first 50 articles in each category.
3. Created CSV files for each category, including fields such as "text," "number of positive sentences," and "number of negative sentences."
4. Evaluated whether fake content tended to contain more positive or negative sentiment sentences.
